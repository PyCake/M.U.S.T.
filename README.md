# M.U.S.T.
M.U.S.T. is a python script which allows you to publish updates and allows your users to download them without having to reinstall the file and is a MUST have for anybody who frequently updates their code.
# Ok ok cool name but what is M.U.S.T.
M.U.S.T. is a tool to help developers that frequently update their code. 
# What does it do?
It allows developers to publish updates to their website and then allows the user to easily download the update without having to redownload the original file.
# How does it work?
Well first the developer of the code must publish the code (which has to be in a special format that is described later) in an html file to a website. Next they publish another html file that simply says what version it is. After that one more file is needed which simply says if downloads are allowed.
# How do I use it?
How to use it is described under the instruction.md
# What is required to use it?
You must have the ##latest## version of Python. We also recommend that you have IDLE as it makes it simple to run the code.
# ===>> IMPORTANT <<===
Please read the license.md before downloading the script.
